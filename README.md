## MOBA-game
This repository includes 2 .csv files of data, 2 .ipynb files of data analysis, and a folder of pictures about visualization results.

#### Two .csv files:
1. "gamenew.csv" is the original data collected via online survey.
2. "game_data.csv" is the dataset built for valid analysis based on the original data file "gamenew.csv".

#### Two .ipynb files:
1. "game_data_clean.ipynb" contains the coding that cleans the original data file "gamenew.csv" and builds the dataset for valid analysis. If you are not interested in how the valid dataset is built, you can skip this file and start your reading from the second .ipynb file.
2. "final analysis (feature importance).ipybn" contains all the codes analyzing the dataset, convering data exploration, data split, baseline model creation, machine learning model creation, 10-fold gridsearch cross-validation and 10-fold cross-validation of each machine learning model and feature importance extracrtion. 

#### One folder of pictures:
In this folder, there are 2 pictures visualized and saved during the analysis, mainly about feature importances of Random Forest models when predicting Neuroticism and Agreeableness.
